Vendor Risk Scoring Model

Each answer is scored 1–5:

1 = High Risk (No controls)
2 = Medium-High Risk (Partial controls)
3 = Medium Risk (Standard controls)
4 = Low Risk (Strong controls)
5 = Very Low Risk (Industry leading controls)

Weighting example:

Domain	Weight
Access Control	15%
Data Protection	20%
Vulnerability Management	20%
Incident Response	15%
BCP/DR	10%
Compliance	10%
Logging & Monitoring	10%

Final score formula:

Σ(domain_score × weight) = Vendor Risk Score


Risk tiers:

Score	Rating
4.0 – 5.0	Low Risk
3.0 – 3.9	Moderate Risk
2.0 – 2.9	High Risk
1.0 – 1.9	Critical Risk
